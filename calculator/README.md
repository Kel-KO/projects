This is a normal functioning calculator starter app i built to kick off the start of KODER.


You can copy the code into your ied and use the command "flask run" to launch a local server and use the app.
Make sure to layout the folders and files in the same structure I have them presented or it won't function properly.
Although it is a starter app, please feel free to leave comments, ideas, and fiddle around with the code yourself.

    Thanks, Kel!!
